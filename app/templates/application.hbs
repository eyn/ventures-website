<section class="our-approach-description">
  <p>Although we are not a fund, we make small seed investments in companies that will make our network stronger.</p>
  <p>Seed investing to us typically means the $100k â€“ $200k size and to be among the first people to invest. For example, we were one of the first investors in Tumblr.</p>
  <p>We love betas / prototypes, not so much decks or business plans. If you want to talk investments, talk to Matt.</p>
